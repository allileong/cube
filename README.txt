Welcome.

REPRESENTATION: Rubik's cube is represented as 6 2-d arrays, each representing a face. 

BASIC MOVES: Basic methods are only called on the front face, and include rotating the right column up/down and rotating the left column up/down.

ORIENTATION MOVES: Methods for changing the view/orientation of the cube. Include rotate_left, rotate_right, cube_clockwise, etc.

COMPLEX MOVES: 
To account for more complex moves such as rotating the back face, the view of the cube may be adjusted by methods such as rotate_left, rotate_right, cube_clockwise, cube_counterclockwise, etc.
Complex moves may be achieved by rotating the cube to a more appropriate orientation, and then performing one or more of the 4 basic moves.
